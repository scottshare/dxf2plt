# Introduction #

Some application / modules, which belongs to AVEVA PDMS, use plot files (PLT) for illustration / pictures of topics inside the application.

These plot files can be created through the AVEVA tool 'plot.exe' per command line parameters.

If you have a lot of such pictures, this is not so comfortable.

That is the reason for **DXF2PLT**.

DXF2PLT is a little conversion tool for DXF files.

You can start it with a GUI => use 'start.cmd' or you can start as an batch job => use 'dxf2plt.exe'.

Then all DXF files inside the programm folder will be converted to PLT files.
